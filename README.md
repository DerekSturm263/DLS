# DLS

DLS is a lightweight game engine where users can create any type of game without any coding knowledge required!

- No code: What most people will enjoy about DLS is that it uses an event-system that allows users to create complex logic without writing any code!
- Online built-in: Creating online experiences has never been easier. A simple toggle on any value will allow it to either be local or networked. It's that easy.
- Deterministic: The use of a custom fixed-point type allows the engine to be completely deterministic. This means that rollback is supported and that your game will run the same every time it's played.
- References, Values, and Assets: DLS uses references and values, meaning that any type can be a reference to any value. Also, any type of value can be made into an easy to read asset.
- No unexpected behavior: The user must be verbose about everything. This means that there is no unspected behavior and that the engine can't crash.
- Many built-in types: Animations, State Machines, Graphs, Maps, Textures, Polygons, Audio Clips, you name it. Any type you could ever need is available right out of the box.
- Generic design: All modules, systems, and types have been built to be as generic as possible. A map of entity refs to strings? Sure. A state machine that returns an audio clip? Easy.
- Lightweight: JSON files are used to store everything related to the game, meaning that loading is quick and that it's technically possible to edit the files without ever using the GUI.
- Easy to use: The built-in modules have all the events and settings you would ever need to create complex games. If you ever needed to, there is a guide on creating custom modules.
- Intuitive GUI: One of our biggest focuses was on creating a GUI that's easy to use. Easily switch scenes, create assets, and look like a pro while doing it.
- Built-in editors: Never have to leave DLS to create assets for your game. DLS has a built-in image editor, audio editor, and more.
- Multi-window support: This is a very niche feature, but something we included for fun. Create and manipulate multiple windows on a computer (if people still made DS games, this would also work for that).

And those are just some of the benefits! Once you use the engine, you'll never want to go back to anything else.
